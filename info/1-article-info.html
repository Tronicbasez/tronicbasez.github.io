        <p> I have been in your place before. It took months just to decided what programming language should I learn. Once I picked up a programming language, I stopped learn because the programming language I picked up would not solve the problem. After a while, I jump into another programmming language, and the same dilemma happened again. You don't have to waste 1.5 years just to decided which programming language should you learn. There is my advice for you </p>

        <h3> Decides what you want to build!!</h3>
        <p> One programming language doesn't have the power to solve all of the problems. It's programming, it's not a magic wand. Each programming language has its weakness and strength.</p>
        <h4>Do you want to build a website?</h4>
        <p>Learn Front-end-language: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. Those are the basic for the part you see in most of the websites out there.</p>
        <p>Learn Back-end-language: PHP+MYSQL for the database part, especially if you want creat some kinda of forum or login system. Python for an interactive database, and also for managing information on your website.</p>
        <h4>Do you want to build IOS(Apple) aps? </h4>
        <img width="100%" src="image/ios.png">
        <p>Learn SWIFT and how to use the  Xcode. SWIFT is the new Apple programing language and it's very practical, and you can build really cool apps with it. Xcode is a development software created by Apple. There's nothing much to say when coming to IOS development, the answer is simple and straightforward</p>
        <h4>Do you want to build Android apps?</h4>
        <img width="100%" src="image/android.png">
        <p>Learn Java and how to use Android Studio. Java is the main language used by Android developer, and also you can use this language in other areas. However, java is also well known for being a pain in the ass, but don't be afraid, if it was easy, everyone would do it and it goes for almost everything in life. Android Studio is the development environment created by Google just for Android developers.</p>

          @media(min-width: 500px) { .example_responsive_3 { width: 468px; height: 60px; } }
          @media(min-width: 800px) { .example_responsive_3 { width: 728px; height: 90px; } }
          </style>

        <h4>Do you want to get into AI(Artificial Inteigence)?</h4>
        <img width="100%" src="image/ai.png">
        <p>Learn Python and Statistic. Python as a language is also used for automating boring and predict stock. Basically, It's a multi-purpose language, you can use for many things. However, it may not be the only language used in this industry. Most of the companies won't tell you, but you can discover what programming language they are using just by looking at job requirements. Statistics is not a programming language, it's science or subject used to analyze the trending, probability and more, but you won't need to master it by now. A mix of probability, charts, graphs will help you.</p>

        <h3> My bias opinion</h3>

        <p>I choose web development languages. After deep thoughts, something came to my mind. It was like a voice in the back of my mind screaming "web is freedom, internet is freedom, what you want is freedom". That's why I chose web development instead of the others. So that product can have access to multiple devices and multiple people, and as a single developer I just can't afford creating an app for IOS, Android, and then create a website. If my startup grows, I'll hire people to help me on that. However, in the last few months, I started to learn another programming language because I like programming and I don't want to limit my knowledge in only one area.</p>
