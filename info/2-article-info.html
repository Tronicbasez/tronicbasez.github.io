        <p> I have been making music for a long time. In the beggining music was a hobbie and then it became a passion. After, monhts of exploring music production I came to a point that I had to implement a production software to level up the quality of my music. Some of you might relate with my case, other might be just tired of using the same production software. I will explain using my experience with software I used. They are ableton live and Fruity loops studio. Both are amazing software, and they can serve your purpose.</p>


        <h2>Fruit Loops Studio pros and cons</h2>
           <img width="100%" src="image/fl-studio-logos.png">
        <p>FL Studio possess many advantages, it allow you to become a pro without too much. Let's start mention all of the FL studio advantages one by one. First, It's very dynamic drag and drop function. In FL Studio, you can creat many form of the same beat and drop easly in the main playlist. Eg: You creat a simple beat, but you want to have multiple type of drum for different part of the beat, you can just copy it and elminate the drum in the second version and then drop it on the main play list. Second, it's very easly to use and has a big community. If you are new in the music production you can learn it fast. Just to show you how big is the FL Stduio community, google any beat you want and ad 'flp' or 'fl studio' and you will find the remake of the beat</p>
           <img width="100%" src="image/fl-youtube.png">
        <p>However, there are some disandvantage that Fruity loops have. The main one is that it might require too much of your computer power. If your computer does not have the power, it might make some noise, which is not convenient when you are trying to equalize the beat. The second, which for me is the biggest. There is no complete version for MAC. If you are Apple fan boy you will have to install windows. Otherwise, you won't get the full pie with Mac version</p>

          @media(min-width: 500px) { .example_responsive_3 { width: 468px; height: 60px; } }
          @media(min-width: 800px) { .example_responsive_3 { width: 728px; height: 90px; } }

        <h2>Ableton Live pros and cons</h2>
        <img width="100%" src="image/ableton.png">
        <p>Ableton live also has a lot advantage. The first one, it has a version for both windows and mac, which is big plus. Secondly, when you are producing there is less noise, which mean less need for masterizing and equalizing. The enviroment is less mess comparing to FL Studio. The biggest advantage is that you can use it for live show. You just connect you keypad and add some sound or music to each one and you ready to be the next skrillex, just kidding, you won't get to that level without hard work.</p>
        <p>However, it also  has it's own disadvantage. The first one, you gonna need musical instrument if you want to be good with ableton live. In FL Studio, music instrument is not a must, if you want to be good at it, but the same doesn't apply to Ableton live. The second and the biggest disadvantage is the community. Ableton live has a small community compared to FL Studio, which make difficult to discoverd how the new music are made.</p>

        <h4>What make your production quality skyrocket</h4>
        <img width="100%" src="image/producer.png">
        <p>You must have a good headphone or an audio system. The best one out there in the market are:</p>
        <p>Scarlet production pack. It's affroadable and you can equalize and list to every single part of the beat without missing one part</p>
