<h3>4 Important advice when come to buy a used car</h2>

<h4>Never underestimate the numbers</h4>
<p>When I say numbers I mean repair cost and depreciation. Even if you do a crazy calculation the outcome might be totally different and out of your control, so be smart and understand you only have a brain and not power to accurately see the future. You might think that the annual repair costs are just a few $100. YOU ARE WRONG!  The repair costs might be even bigger like a half grant. If you are not prepared you will get depressed.</p>

<h4>Negotiate, negotiate and negotiate</h4> 
<img width="100%" src="image/negociate.png">
<p>The car dealer isn't your friend, he has a quota to meet, pressure, and in some cases, family to support and bills to pay like everyone else . and Guess what? you are not his priority. So negotiate and also search for other dealers so that you have options in case this deal doesn't favor you. Also if you don't think it's worth the price tag, you can always walk away because you have options and you only know the price because you compare it with other options<p> 

<h4>Search the car reputation and the model historic</h4> 
<img width="100%" src="image/reputation.png">
<p>This is a very important advice.  I think this advice should be the first ones. Basically, what you have to do is Search for online forums, 'NOTE: Be careful with the car clubs forum or opinion of its members they are like fanboys, sometimes they might be biased or been financed by the car company'. Anyway, you still have to search for car review, and people opinions relate to the car because every car has a defect that might annoy you, or even become a burden to your pocket.</p>

 <h3>My personal experience</h4> 
 <p>last year I bought a used car. I made all the calculation and everything seems to be fine. I open the website I chose up a car and called the guy. We met and we close the deal. After two weeks, the car started to show some defects, I went to a mechanic and it was the alternator that starts show problems. I had no choice because in my university there's no way to go around without a car. So paid the mechanic to fixe, after  3 weeks the belt start to show some defects which caused miss fire, so I had to change, then one of the tires blow, I had to change. I was already pissed off because I only use the car for less than a year and it's already making me go broke. I said, "enough is enough, I gonna sell this car". After I posted the car ads all over social media and car website. I thought nothing bad will happen again, ho boy! how I was wrong. The head gasket starts to show some defects and then the gearbox, then leakage, and on... I was like "what fuck this is the shittiest car I have driven so far". At the same time, I was trying to sell my car everyone where getting rid of the same car models as consequences the market value of car went down dramatically like 25% IN JUST A YEAR!</p>
<p>I had to make a tough choice, peace of mind or keeping the car. and my choice was peace of mind because that car was making me become bitter. Now I look back, and I'm glad I got rid of it.</p>
<p>I sold my car even though I lost money. So you might ask, where did I go wrong and the answer is, I underestimated the real cost of maintaining the car, the market value after 3 years which didn't even get there, I didn't hire a mechanic to check the car. I thought I was being smart by buying the cheapest car. If you combine repair + depreciation of value ( especially when everyone decided to sell it), buying a used car was not worth as I thought. So follow my advice and do what I didn't and if there's a lot of the same being sold its because the car model is a lemon ( a very bitter one).</p>
